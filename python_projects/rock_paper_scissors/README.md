# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

In this code, the user will be prompted to pick a number representing "rock", "paper", or "scissors."

Once an option is chosen, the provided value will be stored in a function. 

Following this, the program will also select a random number which will be passed/stored in the aforementioned function.

Using both the user and computer values, a winner will then be determined by the following ordering:

- rock beats scissors
- scissors beats paper
- paper beats rock

The code uses IntEnum to assign each action with a number. An exception is also created to prevent user from picking any other value 
other than what has been assigned. 

At the end of the program, the user will be prompted to continue playing or ending the game.
